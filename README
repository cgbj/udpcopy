Name:
    udpcopy
    It is an online UDP duplication tool and can be used for testing


Description:
    It can help you find bugs without deploying your server software on your production servers.It can also be used to do smoke testing against your products.


Scenarios:
    1) Distributed stress testing
       Use udpcopy to copy real-world data to stress test your server software. Bugs that only can be produced in high-stress situations can be found.

    2) Hot backup

    3) Online testing
       Prove the new system is stable and find bugs that only occur in the real world.

    4) Benchmark


Usage:
    1) Install
       a) download the source code from github:
          git clone http://github.com/wangbin579/udpcopy
       b) sh autogen.sh
       c) ./configure
       d) make
       e) make install

    2) Run:
       a) on the source host (root privilege is required):
          ./udpcopy -x local_port-remote_ip:remote_port 
 
       b) on the target host 
          iptables -I OUTPUT -p udp --sport port -j QUEUE # if not set

Note:
    1) It is tested on Linux only (kernal 2.6 or above).
    2) Udpcopy may lose packets hence lose requests.
    3) Udpcopy is single-threaded now.
